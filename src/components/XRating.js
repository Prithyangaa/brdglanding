      <p>
        Reputation shouldn’t be a number you buy or a testimonial you chase.
      </p>
      <p>
        The X Rating™ is your verified reputation score on brdg — built through what you actually do.
      </p>
      <p>
        It evolves with every project, collaboration and delivery — showing others your consistency, impact and value.
      </p>
      <p>
        No inflated stars. No fake reviews. Just your contribution, recorded and recognised.
      </p>
    </section>
