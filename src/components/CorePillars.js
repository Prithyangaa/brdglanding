      <h3>Work</h3>
      <p>
        Your brdg Profile™ is your operating system for visibility. <br />
        Video-first. Skill-tagged. Action-based. <br />
        Designed to help people see what you can actually do — not what you claim.
      </p>

      <h3>Bank</h3>
      <p>
        Vault™ secures every transaction — with milestone tracking and trust-first design. <br />
        No late payments. No platform holds. Just fair, verified flow of value.
      </p>

      <h3>Play</h3>
      <p>
        brdg Explorer and The Connection Lab™ help you find local and global spaces to build, connect and belong. <br />
        You meet collaborators — not just contacts. <br />
        You create experiences — not just profiles.
